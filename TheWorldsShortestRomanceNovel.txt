The World's Shortest Romance Novel
-- Zachary Smith

My half-brother lives a
sunken life. His house is the
sea-green ribcage of a wrecked
ship. Most days, he wears a

diving suit and spends hour
upon hour drifting with the
current, tethered only by a
thin line stretching away

towards some unknown
surface. At night, far off, he
can see great, slow fish, each
one lit up like a whole city.

Once a fish swam close and
he could see that its eyes
were on fire. Once his
breathing tube got tangled

in some seaweed. He put
something complicated in
my hand and said here, hold
this but don’t ever touch it.

A while or maybe 50 years
later I decided to have a look.
We were standing in a round
puddle of yellow light there

on the threshold and he said,
this is the skull of a starling.
If you put it up to your ear
and listen very carefully

you can hear an evening
sky and violet air rushing
through the door to be born
on the other side of the world.
