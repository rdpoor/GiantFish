# GiantFish

"The World's Shortest Romance Novel", a poem by Zachary Smith, set to music
(or something resembling music).  Built using the `pygmu2` audio/music library.

## Layout
- `src/giantfish/`: reusable library code
- `scripts/`: runnable entry points
- `data/cache/`: local cache (not tracked)
- `data/assets/`: small versioned assets (e.g., impulse responses)
- `data/final/`: final works (tracked unless you choose LFS)

## Quickstart
This project uses `uv` for environment management.
