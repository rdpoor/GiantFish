# GiantFish

A Python-based audio and music project built on top of the `pygmu2` library.

## Layout
- `src/giantfish/`: reusable library code
- `scripts/`: runnable entry points
- `data/cache/`: local cache (not tracked)
- `data/assets/`: small versioned assets (e.g., impulse responses)
- `data/final/`: final works (tracked unless you choose LFS)

## Quickstart
This project uses `uv` for environment management.
